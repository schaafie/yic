# Yic
You're in Control: Elixir JAM Stack based web solution for 
Content, Digital Asset, Site, Form and Flow management

The main idea is that all interaction is done via an API layer.
Webpages contain web components for interaction with the server
Just as the site, the admin site will be maintained using the same principles.
Phoenix manages the API layer. The sites (including admin) will be JAM Stack based.

Mix commands for basic structure

mix phx.new yic
cd yic
mix ecto.create
